# Microservices and Distributed Systems

This project involves decomposing a monolithic application into microservices architecture. Microservices architecture breaks down a large application into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business function. Communication between services will be implemented using RESTful APIs or message brokers like RabbitMQ. Additionally, the project includes handling service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance to ensure reliability and scalability.

## Features

- __Microservices Decomposition__: Decompose the monolithic application into smaller, independent microservices.
- __Service Communication__: Implement communication between services using RESTful APIs or message brokers like RabbitMQ.
- __Service Discovery__: Implement service discovery to locate and communicate with other services dynamically.
- __Load Balancing__: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service to improve performance and availability.
- __Fault Tolerance__: Implement strategies to handle failures gracefully and ensure the reliability of the system.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Microservices Decomposition Plan__: Define a plan for breaking down the monolithic application into microservices.
- __Service Communication Protocols__: Choose and implement communication protocols such as RESTful APIs or message brokers.
- __Service Discovery Implementation__: Implement service discovery mechanisms using tools like Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes.
- __Load Balancing Configuration__: Configure load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances of services.
- __Fault Tolerance Strategies__: Implement fault tolerance strategies such as circuit breakers, retries, and fallback mechanisms.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Microservices Decomposition__: Identify and extract cohesive modules from the monolithic application to create independent microservices.
- __Service Communication Setup__: Implement RESTful APIs or message broker configurations to enable communication between microservices.
- __Service Discovery Integration__: Integrate service discovery mechanisms into microservices to enable dynamic service registration and discovery.
- __Load Balancer Configuration__: Configure load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances of microservices.
- __Fault Tolerance Implementation__: Implement fault tolerance strategies such as circuit breakers, retries, and fallback mechanisms to handle failures gracefully.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Integration Testing__: Test the interaction between microservices to ensure seamless communication.
- __Load Testing__: Test the scalability of the system by simulating high loads and monitoring performance.
- __Fault Injection Testing__: Simulate failures in the system to evaluate fault tolerance mechanisms.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Microservices Decomposition__: Decompose the monolithic application into microservices according to the defined plan.
- __Service Communication__: Implement RESTful APIs or message brokers to enable communication between microservices.
- __Service Discovery Test__: Verify that services can discover and communicate with each other dynamically.
- __Load Balancing Test__: Test load balancing configurations to ensure even distribution of traffic.
- __Fault Tolerance Test__: Simulate failures in the system and verify that fault tolerance mechanisms handle them gracefully.
